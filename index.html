      <h2>Reasons to visit us!</h2>
      <div id="box1">
        <p> We are a brand new up and coming recording studio. We have a modern, state of the art space and equipment
          Rainwater is set up with high quality recording in mind. Our artists will not need to spend their money 
          on unnecessary and expensive equipment they won't use, as everything that is essential to achieving a clean, 
          great sounding recording can be found in the studio.
          At the heart of the studio is a Logic Pro audio recording system, with 32 Midus Venus preamps and 
          a great selection of microphones suited for all types of recording.

          <p>Our experienced producer has over 10 years experience. He has worked on thousand of tracks in 
            endless genres ranging from classical to heavy metal. He is a professional musician and will treat 
            every track with the utmost care and respect. After all, music
              is an art and should be treated as such.  
              From writing, to performing, to recording, to mixing and mastering, we are… in the words of Jimi Hendrix… 
              experienced. There is no magic button or plug-in that just works for every recording. Each recording 
              and each song needs to be addressed and attended to on an individual basis.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="box3">
         <p> We cater for all genres whether you're an accoustic sinfer/songwritter or part of a large instrumental 
           band. We've got you covered!
