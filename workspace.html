    <h2 id="about">Our Work Space</h2>
    <br>
      <p>Here at Concrete Studios, we have the best quality, state of the art recording equipmnet. We use FL studio
         to edit and produce your music/audio and upload your finished product to your personal cloud folder when finsihed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Our studio is large enough to comfortably fit a full 6 piece band. The studio consits of a production area with
       lounge and coffee. Separate studio area with amplifiers, stands, microphones and full drum kit (clients must bring 
       their own skins and breakables). And a separate recording booth.  </p>
       <br>
      <p>   The studio itself is a compact and cosy building, with a treated performance room for achieving 
        great sound, and a wood burning stove for staying warm during those rainy day jam sessions. The 
        studio houses a small selection of amps and instruments, always available for our artists to record with.
        At the heart of the studio is a Logic Pro audio recording system, with 32 Midus Venus preamps and a great
         selection of microphones suited for all types of recording.  
      </p>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Concrete studio is set up with high quality recording in mind. Our artists will not need to spend their money 
        on unnecessary and expensive equipment they won't use, as everything that is essential to achieving a clean,
         great sounding recording can be found in the studio. 
     </p></p>
